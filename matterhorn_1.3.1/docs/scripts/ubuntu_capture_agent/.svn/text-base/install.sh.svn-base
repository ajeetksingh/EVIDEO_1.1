# Help for the device flavor prompt

Setting this value correctly is important to ensure video content is processed and distributed correctly."
# Help for the device queue prompt

A value bigger than the default may be selected, as long as the machine has enough memory to allocate it.
Please see Framerates, Bitrates and Queues at http://opencast.jira.com/wiki/display/MH/Tweaking+1.0+(Advanced) for more information."

# Help for the prompt for the time between two schedule polls

Testers should choose a value of 1 minute so that they can schedule recordings to start immediately"
