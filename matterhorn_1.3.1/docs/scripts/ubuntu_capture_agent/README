Capture Agent Installation
==========================

Execute install.sh to being installation process. You will need sudo privileges, 
so it should be run with 'sudo' or by the 'root' user. Also, there is no need to
download all the installation scripts, since the install.sh script will fetch
them from the matterhorn site in case they are not present in the directory from
where the script is run.

The script sets up a *new* user to control everything matterhorn related on the 
system. This user will be given sudo privileges because it needs to control many
devices that are owned by root as well as insert modules into the kernel.

At this point the project only supports using the Epiphan VGA2USB device for
capturing the screen, therefore the script must install the driver to use this.
It will try to locate the driver based on the kernel, but if there is no successful
match, either it was excluded from the script or it does not exist yet on the
Epiphan Linux driver download page http://www.epiphan.com/downloads/linux. If it
does not exist on the Epiphan download page then it can be requested by emailing
info@epiphan.com with your kernel information. 

Alternatively, if your driver is not listed in the script itself, but does exist
on the Epiphan website, you can use option 9 to input the URL to the appropriate
driver which will then be downloaded and installed. No modification of the script
is necessary to incorporate a new driver.

The sources which APT uses is modified so that the machine has all that it 
requires right now for installing dependencies. To avoid conflicts it backs up
the original sources list and creates a new one. The necessary dependencies are
then installed from these sources using apt-get. These dependencies are:

  alsa-utils
  v4l-conf 
  ivtv-utils
  maven2 
  sun-java6-jdk
  subversion
  wget
  curl
  openssh-server
  gcc
  gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-base
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly-multiverse
  gstreamer0.10-plugins-base-apps
  ntp
  
Felix is downloaded from the Apache website and installed in the home directory
of the "matterhorn" user. 

In order to use the video4linux devices with Java libjv4linfo.so has to be
installed so that is downloaded from its homepage and installed using ant.

Once all of the dependencies have been installed the trunk from the 
Matterhorn codebase is checked out. However the user can choose another location
to be checked out instead (e.g. branches)
  
This code is then compiled and loaded into Felix by executing:

  mvn clean install -Pcapture -DdeployTo=${FELIX_HOME}/load
  
The script then sets up all of the devices it can recognize on your system using
a few v4l tools bundled with v4l-conf. It will then prompt for information 
regarding the devices (the video standard they should use -NTSC, PAL, etc...-, 
the names that should be used to identify them and their associated flavors).
After that it finishes creating the capture agent configuration by setting up
the capture agent name, creating the directory structure for capturing and prompting
for the Matterhorn Core server to push its status to.

After the script runs successfully, everytime the machine reboots the Matterhorn
Capture Agent will be executed. If it isn't, you can execute it manually by
running ${FELIX_HOME}/bin/start_matterhorn.sh as the "matterhorn" user. Also, the
logging information is available at ${FELIX_HOME}/logs.

Questions should go to the Matterhorn list (matterhorn@opencastproject.org)
