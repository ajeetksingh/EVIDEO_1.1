   * properties on the newly created Elements, addElementsToBin to add these new Elements to the Bin and finally
   * linkElements to link your new Elements together and possibly to the queue and audio converter.

   * new Element as the last one in your Bin (that will act as the source for the Consumers) please return it's src pads
   * as the ones to ghost so that it can be connected to the Consumers.

   * @throws UnableToSetElementPropertyBecauseElementWasNullException
   *           If setProperties is called before createElements this Exception is thrown because all of the Elements
   *           will be null.
   * @throws UnableToCreateGhostPadsForBinException
   *           If getSrcPad doesn't return a Pad that can be used as a ghostpad for this Bin then this Exception is
   *           thrown.

   *           it is null we cannot create this Producer and therefore this Exception is thrown.
   * @throws UnableToCreateElementException
   *           If for any reason an Element is attempted to be created that this particular machine doesn't have the
   *           module necessary installed this Exception will bet thrown.
