/**
 * Scheduler service.
 * The scheduler creates events that should be recorded on a Matterhorn Capture Agent at the specified time and date.
 * It is intended that the user adds the events with the scheduler web interface that is provided in the admin tools 
 * (currently http://localhost:8080/admin/scheduler.html).
 * 
 * The service communicates with the UI over some methods that allow to add an new event, update an event, 
 * delete an event and to list the events in the database in various ways. 
 * The Capture Agent get the events belonging to him as an iCalendar, in which the Dublin Core Metadata and 
 * Capture agent specific technical metadata is included as Base64 encoded files.
 * 
 * This is only the API see the current implementation for more details.
